The theme can be regenerated by **`numix-paper-icon-theme-sh`**, or modify the script to add others icons.

The theme contains:
  * Folder icons: grey icons from Numix (instead of yellow).

  * Rest come from Numix theme.
  
## Install
Unzip `numix-paper-icon-theme.tgz` in `/usr/share/icons/` or `~/.icons`.
